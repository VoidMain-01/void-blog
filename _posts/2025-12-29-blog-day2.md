## Entering the Dev mode

Hello everyone! I'm **Void Main**. And this is the day 2 of my blogging. I am really happy to share that I was working on ATM functionality app, and it is completed today.

## About the app

The app is CLI based and made in **Java**. I have implemented better error handling to it, keeping in mind that the program doesn't crash. While making this project I learned a lot, I improved my foundation in OOPs concept, error handling using try catch.

```java
try 
{
  	double depAmt = sc.nextDouble();
    user.deposit(depAmt);
} 
catch (Exception e)
{
    System.out.println("Invalid Amount! Enter amount in numbers.");
    sc.nextLine();
}
```
You can check the complete code and details available on my **Github** account.

### Future Improvements
I am planning to create new users and show transaction history.
If you have any suggestions feel free to contact me.

```java
System.out.println("Busy in patching the errors");
```
